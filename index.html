            My career as a professional has led me to participate in the production of various editorial pieces. These pieces have been mainly created for youth illustrations. I have also done work on
            animation and comic projects, where I have had to do the conceptual art of characters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, as a designer, I have done branding and logo design work for various clients. This includes coffee brands, shops, and business associations, which have been customized in various
            styles and publishing pieces.
